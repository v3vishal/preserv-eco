        <h1>Energy Transfer Efficiency and the 10% Law</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <p>In the 2019 fires that occurred in Bandipur, a lot of flora and fauna was affected by the colossal fires that damaged a huge amount of trees.</p>
        
        <p>The forest fire in 2019 of Bandipur led to a reduction in forest coverage of around 3.46% as per the difference in forest cover area in 2011 and 2019, which translates to an estimated reduction of 12 to 15 lakh trees over the total area of nearly 1400 sq. km of area, assuming around 100 fully grown trees (plus or minus) per acre.</p>
        
        <p>Here, to calculate the amount of Tigers that could have benefitted by the amount of trees lost, the following was done;</p>

        <p>With the help of the <span class="highlight">1% law of energy obtaining efficiency</span> and the <span class="highlight">10% law of energy transferring efficiency</span>, an estimated value for the number of animals in each trophic level is calculated.</p>
            
        <p>As per the <span class="highlight">10% law of energy transfer efficiency</span>, with an assumption of 1000 Joules of energy absorption by a tree on 1,00,000 joules of sun energy that would fall on the surface of Earth, that translates to 1 Joule of energy transferred to a tiger, where the tiger is the tertiary consumer. With an estimated 5000 Joules of energy consumption for a tiger per day, this would mean that around 5000 trees would be needed to sustain the energy requirement of a tiger per day.</p>

        <p>Therefore, a loss of 12 to 15 lakhs of trees would have indirectly (via the food chain) meant that the energy requirement for around 250 to 300 tigers would have been impacted.</p>

        <p>Presently, we have a very small number of tigers. The current extent of forestation and tree density is essential to maintain and sustain the current population. Any further reduction will not only create pressure on the existing ecosystem but also limit further expansion of the tiger population. Incidents like fire, leading to a depletion of tree density would hence be detrimental to wildlife at large and in this case, tigers are the ones affected by this.</p>
        
        <div class="invasive-species">
            <h2>Invasive Species across Few Trophic Levels:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Plants: Water hyacinth, Carrot grass, Siam weed, Wild tamarind, Black wattle, Mesquite, Lantana camara, and Pogostemon benghalensis - these are a few invasive plants that can choke native species preventing energy transfer to the next trophic level, i.e. Herbivores and top predators.</li>
                <li>Herbivores: The Yellow Crazy Ant species is one of the most invasive species...</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These all together indirectly affect the tiger causing endangerment and ecological imbalance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="human-impact">
            <h2>Impact on Humans and Society:</h2>
            <p>The imbalance in trophic levels and the disruption of the ecosystem have profound impacts on humans and our society. As integral parts of the food web, we are interconnected with the well-being of other species.</p>
            
            <p>Decreased tiger population, driven by the loss of trees and disruption in the food chain, can lead to an increase in certain species that tigers would typically control. This imbalance could result in overpopulation of herbivores, affecting vegetation and potentially leading to increased human-wildlife conflicts as herbivores encroach on human settlements in search of food.</p>
            
            <p>Additionally, invasive species can further exacerbate the situation. The spread of invasive plants and herbivores can disrupt local ecosystems, affecting agriculture, water resources, and even human health.</p>
            
            <p>It is crucial for us to recognize our role in the ecosystem and strive for a balanced coexistence. Conservation efforts not only benefit wildlife but also contribute to the overall health and sustainability of our environment, directly impacting the quality of life for us and future generations.</p>

        <div class="energy-calculation">
            <h2>Carbon Calculator (CC):</h2>
            <p>CC (Carbon Calculator) is used to calculate the <span class="highlight">SOC (SOIL ORGANIC CARBON) from SOM (SOIL ORGANIC MATTER)</span> and vice versa, allowing us to calculate the organic matter in the soil. Similarly, we can calculate the carbon % in the soil from the SOM and help improve the organic matter. We used the formulas: <span class="highlight">[Organic matter (%) = total organic carbon (%) x 1.72] and [SOC stock in tonnes of carbon per hectare (tC/ha) = (soil organic carbon %) x (mass of soil in a given volume)].</span></p>
